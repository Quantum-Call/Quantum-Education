    "\n",
    "This material is intended to educate **software engineers** in certain aspects of Quantum Computing, therefore its focus will be on conveying the conceptual ideas in a form digestible to them, and supporting it with exercises to reinforce those concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of that pedagogical approach, **this material won't lead with or heavily leverage the concepts and language indigenous to physics and math**, but only in those terms most easily digestible to the modern software engineer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook is <font color=\"red\">**not intended as a stand alone educational vehicle**</font>  - it's meant to be accompanied by a decicated power point deck that contains the main concepts to be presented by an instructor - **it is intended as a vehicle for a hands on workshop environment to facilitate learning through a guided experience.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:-** Because of the above educational approach:\n",
    "1. There is a certain amount of basic Quantum Computing knowledge that is assumed.\n",
    "2. An active internet connection is **always** assumed.\n",
    "3. Online references/links will be provided where appropriate\n",
    "4. References to books will be made where appropriate\n",
    "5. Much of this material is **dense and detailed**, the reader is <font color=\"red\">**cautioned**</font> to be careful and slow to digest the *nuances* of the material.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you will be exposed to - High level: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Software engineers in the Quantum Computing space need to **<font color=\"blue\">gain a mastery of the simulation frameworks and tools used to understand and solve problems quantumly</font>**. Under the hood, the **<font color=\"red\">simulators mathematically represent the \"Ideal\" manifestations of quantum hardware</font>** that (theoretically) the \"Actual\" quantum hardware would behave exactly like. For the software engineer, this is the preferred situation as it permits them to understand and solve problems w/out being bound to the limitations of the hardware as it matures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given the above, there are a host of technical concepts that need to be **<font color=\"red\">understood experientially</font>** - we'll intentionally employ a vendor / framework agnostic approach to focus on the delivery of concept understanding and intuition procurement as the main value-add.\n",
